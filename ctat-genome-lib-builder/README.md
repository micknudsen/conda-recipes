# CTAT-GENOME-LIB-BUILDER

This folder contains a recipe for [CTAT-GENOME-LIB-BUILDER](https://github.com/TrinityCTAT/ctat-genome-lib-builder). After installing, the command

* `prep_genome_lib`

is available from the prompt. Note that there are no formal releases of CTAT-GENOME-LIB-BUILDER, and therefore I have not even attempted to make a bioconda recipe.

# Install

The package is available on my conda channel:

```
conda install -c micknudsen ctat-genome-lib-builder
```
