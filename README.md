# conda-recipes

In my production workflows, I use conda for software management. When I need some bioinformatic software which is not available on [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io), I always try to contribute a recipe there. However, sometimes the software is difficult to package, but an incomplete recipe may still be useful. Also, sometimes patches of software which is no longer maintained are needed. I gather such recipes here, and they are all available on the [micknudsen](https://anaconda.org/micknudsen) channel.

See individual README files for comments and documentation.
